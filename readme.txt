This modification adds a BBCode to view Vine videos and pictures.

The BBCode takes these forms:
[code]
[vine]{vine ID}[/vine]
[vine width=x height=x]{vine ID}[/vine]
[/code]
where [b]{vine ID}[/b] is the [b]bnbO1QXLWhr[/b] part of the [b]http://vine.co/v/bnbO1QXLWhr[/b] URL.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
There are two new settings on the [b]Modifications Settings[/b] page:
o Vine default width
o Vine default height
