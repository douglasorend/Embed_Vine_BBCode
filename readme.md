## Introduction
This modification adds a BBCode to view Vine videos and pictures.

The BBCode takes these forms:
    
    [vine]{vine ID}[/vine]
    [vine width=x height=x]{vine ID}[/vine]
    
where **{vine ID}** is the **bnbO1QXLWhr** part of the **http://vine.co/v/bnbO1QXLWhr** URL.

## Admin Settings
There are two new settings on the **Modifications Settings** page:

- Vine default width
- Vine default height
